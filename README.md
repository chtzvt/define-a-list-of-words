define a list of words
======================

This is a bash script that takes a list of words (that you have in a file named "words"), defines them, and writes the definitions to a file named "definitions".

It's a great tool for batch processing dictionary work.

Before use, be sure to install the sdcv package, and follow this tutorial to load a dictionary onto your machine:

Since the link to the StarLink tarball in that tutorial is dead, use this link instead:

I have a list of words loaded into the words file as an example, but you can replace these with the words you want to define. 

Have fun!
